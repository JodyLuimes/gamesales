Step 1 – Create table
CREATE TABLE sales_genre
(
Genre string,
Global_Sales float,
Critic_Score int
);

To check that the table was created:

SELECT * FROM sales_genre LIMIT 10;

Step 2 – Insert data from “Sales” into the table:

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE sales_genre
SELECT Genre, Global_Sales, Critic_Score
FROM sales;

Check that the transformation worked:

SELECT * FROM sales_genre LIMIT 10;

Step 3 – mutate data to round Global Sales

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE sales_genre
SELECT Genre, ROUND(Global_Sales,0) AS Global_Sales, Critic_Score
FROM sales_genre;

Check that the mutation worked:

SELECT * FROM sales_genre LIMIT 10

Step 4 – Filter to only look at Critic_Score that is greater than 0

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE sales_genre
SELECT *
FROM sales_genre
WHERE Critice_Score > 0;

Check that the filter worked:

SELECT * FROM sales_genre LIMIT 10

Step 5 – Arrange the data by Critic_Score (highest to lowest)

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE sales_genre
SELECT *
FROM sales_genre
ORDER BY Critic_Score DESC;

Check that the sort worked:

SELECT * FROM sales_genre LIMIT 10
